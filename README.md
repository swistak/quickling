A set of scripts for staging servers, allowing for rapid deployments and setup of new sites.

There are currently 2 versions of this script - shell & ruby. Shell version evolved from set of v simpel scripts I wrote some time ago.
If/When I have some spare time I plan to rewrite it to use Ruby and Thosr library, since maintaining shell version can quickly become quite hard.

for now use shell version.
